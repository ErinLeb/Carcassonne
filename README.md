# Game of Dominoes and Carcassonne

Welcome to the Game of Dominoes and Carcassonne! This project is a Java application that combines two classic tabletop games into one convenient package. The GUI allows you to easily play both games with friends or against AI opponents.

## Features

This project includes the following features:

- Two classic tabletop games in one convenient package : Dominoes and Carcassonne.
- A GUI interface for easy play, as well as a terminal version for a more traditional gaming experience of the game Dominoes.
- Built-in game rules for both Dominoes and Carcassonne, accessible from the main menu.
- AI opponents
- Customizable game settings, including the number of players (2-6 for Dominoes, 2-4 for Carcassonne), the number of tiles (15-100 for Dominoes), and the number of bots (0-number of players).  
- The possibility to quit the game any time.  
- A final ranking of players after each game of Dominoes.  
- The possibility to start a new game once you finished one.  
- The possibility to play again with the same parameters in the terminal version (including keeping your scores for a return match !)
